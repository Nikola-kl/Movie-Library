This is a movie library that pulls my database from my firebase cloud.
Made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

The initial phase of the application included an environment setup with webpack and a basic design setup.
The next stage of development included a firebase database with my own custom movies and finished functionalities.
Later in the application development I substituted vanilla CSS with Tailwind to recreate the same design (with some adjustments).

To see the functionality with the custom movies I made, use these in the index.js file:
